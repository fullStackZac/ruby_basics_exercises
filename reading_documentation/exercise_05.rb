Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

ANSWER: Per the documentation (literals) if you need to express very large numbers, instead of using commas just use underscores
        examples: 1_000_000 instead of 1,000,000        55_543_985_211_090 instead of 55,543,985,211,090
